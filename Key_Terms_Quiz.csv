1,An equation or formula that simplifies and represents reality.,Model,Least squares,Regression line (Line of best fit),Slope,20,1
2,"An equation of a line. To interpret a linear model, the variables (along with their W's) and their units must be known.",Linear model,Residuals,Model,Least squares,20,1

4,Differences between observed data values and the corresponding predicted values from the regression model.,Residuals,Intercept,Regression line (Line of best fit),Predicted value,20,1
5,A criterion that specifies the unique line minimizing the variance of the residuals or the sum of the squared residuals.,Least squares,Predicted value,Linear model,Residuals,20,1
6,"The tendency for each predicted value to be closer to its mean than the corresponding x-value is to its mean, due to the correlation being less than 1.0.",Regression to the mean,Linear model,Intercept,Model,20,1
