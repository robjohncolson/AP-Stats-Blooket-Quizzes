1,"When we estimate the standard deviation of a sampling distribution using statistics found from the data, the estimate is called a standard error.",Standard Error,Critical Value,One-proportion z-interval,20,1,1.0
2,A level C confidence interval for a model parameter is an interval of values usually of the form Estimate Â± Margin of Error found from data in such a way that C% of all random samples will yield intervals that capture the true parameter value.,Confidence Interval,One-proportion z-interval,Standard Error,20,1,1.0
3,A confidence interval for the true value of a proportion.,One-proportion z-interval,Confidence Interval,Standard Error,20,1,1.0
4,"In a confidence interval, the extent of the interval on either side of the observed statistic value is called the margin of error. It is typically the product of a critical value from the sampling distribution and a standard error from the data.",Margin of Error,Critical Value,Standard Error,One-proportion z-interval,20,1.0
5,The number of standard errors to move away from the sample statistic to specify an interval that corresponds to the specified level of confidence.,Critical Value,Margin of Error,Standard Error,20,1,1.0
