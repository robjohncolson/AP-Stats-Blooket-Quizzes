(Only include Answer #)"
2,The distribution of a variable gives the possible values of the variable and the relative frequency of each value.,Distribution,Pie chart,Area principle,Simpson’s paradox,20,1
3,"In a statistical display, each data value should be represented by the same amount of area.",Area principle,Distribution,Bar chart (Relative frequency bar chart),Pie chart,20,1
4,Bar charts show a bar whose area represents the count (or percentage) of observations for each category of a categorical variable.,Bar chart (Relative frequency bar chart),Frequency table (Relative frequency table),Pie chart,Segmented bar chart,20,1
5,Pie charts show how a 'whole' divides into categories by showing a wedge of a circle whose area corresponds to the proportion in each category.,Pie chart,Simpson’s paradox,Frequency table (Relative frequency table),Distribution,20,1
6,The methods in this chapter are appropriate for displaying and describing categorical data. Be careful not to use them with quantitative data.,Categorical data condition,Conditional distribution,Contingency table,Simpson’s paradox,20,1
7,"A contingency table displays counts and, sometimes, percentages of individuals falling into named categories on two or more variables.",Contingency table,Frequency table (Relative frequency table),Categorical data condition,Pie chart,20,1
8,"In a contingency table, the distribution of either variable alone is called the marginal distribution. The counts or percentages are the totals found in the margins of the table.",Marginal distribution,Distribution,Pie chart,Area principle,20,1
9,The distribution of a variable restricting the Who to consider only a smaller group of individuals is called a conditional distribution.,Conditional distribution,Simpson’s paradox,Bar chart (Relative frequency bar chart),Distribution,20,1
10,Variables are said to be independent if the conditional distribution of one variable is the same for each category of the other.,Independence,Distribution,Frequency table (Relative frequency table),Pie chart,20,1
11,A segmented bar chart displays the conditional distribution of a categorical variable within each category of another variable.,Segmented bar chart,Categorical data condition,Distribution,Marginal distribution,20,1
12,"When averages are taken across different groups, they can appear to contradict the overall averages. This is known as 'Simpson’s paradox'.",Simpson’s paradox,Marginal distribution,Independence,Categorical data condition,20,1
