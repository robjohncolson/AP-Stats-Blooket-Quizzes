1,Predicting values far from the ones used to find the linear model equation is unsafe and should not be trusted.,Extrapolation,Leverage,Influential point,Outlier,20,1
2,"A data point that stands away from others, particularly in regression, can have a large residual or high leverage.",Outlier,Extrapolation,Lurking variable,Influential point,20,1
3,"Data points with x-values far from the mean of X exert leverage on a linear model, influencing the slope and intercept.",Leverage,Influential point,Outlier,Extrapolation,20,1
4,"A data point that, when omitted, results in a regression model with a significantly different slope.",Influential point,Outlier,Extrapolation,Lurking variable,20,1
5,"A variable not part of the model but affects how the variables appear to be related, complicating causal inference.",Lurking variable,Leverage,Extrapolation,Influential point,20,1
