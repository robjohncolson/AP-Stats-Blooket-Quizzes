1,An equation or formula that simplifies and represents reality.,Model,Residuals,Regression to the mean,Standard error (S.),20,1
2,"An equation of a line. To interpret a linear model, the variables (along with their W's) and their units must be known.",Linear model,Residuals,Slope,Predicted value,20,1
3,"The value found for a given x-value in the data, calculated by substituting the x-value into the regression equation. These values lie exactly on the fitted line.",Predicted value,Regression to the mean,Regression line (Line of best fit),Intercept,20,1
4,Differences between observed data values and the corresponding predicted values from the regression model.,Residuals,Slope,Regression line (Line of best fit),Standard error (S.),20,1
5,A criterion that specifies the unique line minimizing the variance of the residuals or the sum of the squared residuals.,Least squares,Residuals,Slope,Intercept,20,1
6,"The tendency for each predicted value to be closer to its mean than the corresponding x-value is to its mean, due to the correlation being less than 1.0.",Regression to the mean,Linear model,Least squares,Slope,20,1
7,The particular linear equation that satisfies the least squares criterion.,Regression line (Line of best fit),Predicted value,Least squares,Slope,20,1
8,"The value in 'y-units per x-unit,' representing changes in predicted values of y corresponding to changes of one unit in x.",Slope,Linear model,Predicted value,Model,20,1
